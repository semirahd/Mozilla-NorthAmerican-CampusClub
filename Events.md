## Grace Hopper Celebration for Women in Computing


**What**: Grace Hopper Open Source Day - A day dedicated to learning Open Source Participation.  
Mozilla is one of 7 open organizations providing participants with real world opportunity to get involved, 
and hopefully make a small contribution.

**Where**: Houston Texas - Grace Hopper Conference where over 15, 000 women will attend this week long conference.

**Who**: Participants in Open Source Day range in age, race, gender identity and experience.   
Primarily these are young graduates at the BSC or MSC level, who have some mean skills already but want to use open source to
level-up those skills while saving the world.

**Who Else**:  ‘Mentors’ sign up based on their familiarity with the skills in the project.    
So right now, our mentors are skilled in Open Source, specifically have skills in Django, Python, Github.  
In previous years these have been senior level people in the tech industry (ie: Google Engineers), and CS professors (men and women).

## Challenge

Must have these criteria

- one or more activities/tasks can be completed in less than six hours
- connects participants with Mozilla's mission
- involves a creative element - like prototyping, or design!
- is a contribution (can be a prototype, an idea!, code, paper or otherwise)
- inspires and connects attendees to participation at Mozilla.
- includes follow up steps
- Includes Django and Python  

**Goals of Campus Clubs**: Bring more CS students through in person to the open sources world and for Mozilla’s mission 

 
Key Performance Indicators - 
Feedback on existing program - 5 new inputs
New activities - 2 new paper 
New partnerships - x
New recruitment  - x (recruitment strategy or RCs, or CCs) 


Thinking about what inspires CS students to get involved in starting open web groups/clubs on their campuses
Develop a series of activities/contribution areas

# INITIAL PROPOSAL

Github account

Format:  Introduce Mozilla, brainstorm open source participation generally and specific to campuses/clubs,. Prototype three solutions that engage students on campus to get involved with Campus Campaign. Only one will involve coding.   

Message: You’ll be learning about open source participation while building a better experience for others in the Mozilla Campus Campaign !  



Discussion: what types of contribution can you provide to an open source project (10 minutes)

We’ll have 3 stations.  
Ask people to select based on interest.  They’ll build out the project using what we’ve learned in the earlier sessions about engagement, barriers and student engagement.

We’ll submit all work to :  

https://github.com/mozilla/Campus-Activities/issues



If we have one - we might just do that as part of the big presentations at the end.

We can teach and discuss web development and cyber security as mozilla firefox is all about development of the web literacy through open source programming.
