# Contributing to North American Mozilla Campus Clubs

Welcome to the North American Mozilla Campus Clubs GitHub repository, and thank you for thinking about contributing! :smiley::heart::smiley:

The point of this file is to make it suuuuuper easy for you to get involved. So if you have any questions that aren't covered here please let us know! Check out the [Share your thoughts](#share-your-thoughts) section below for more details.

Before you start you'll need to set up a free [GitHub][link_github] account and sign in. Here are some [instructions][link_signupinstructions].

Scroll down or jump to one of the following sections:

* [Make a change](#make-a-change)
* [Recognising contributions](#recognising-contributions)
* [Get in touch](#how-to-get-in-touch)


## Make a change

Once you've identified one of the issues above that you feel you can contribute to, you're ready to make a change to the project repository! :tada::smiley:

1. First, describe what you're planning to do as a comment to the issue, (and this might mean making a new issue).

    Check in with a member of the N.A. Campus Clubs team to ensure you aren't overlapping with work that's currently underway and that everyone is on the same page with the goal of the work you're going to carry out.
    
    [This blog][link_pushpullblog] is a nice explanation of why putting this work in up front is so useful to everyone involved.

2. Make the changes you've discussed.

    Try to keep the changes focused rather than changing lots of things at once. If you feel tempted to branch out then please *literally* branch out: create [separate branches][link_branches] for different updates to make the next step much easier!

3. Submit a [pull request][link_pullrequest].
    
    A member of the executive team will review your changes, have a bit of discussion and hopefully merge them in!

**Success!!** :balloon::balloon::balloon: Well done! And thank you :smiley::tada::sparkles:

## Recognising contributions

If you're logged into GitHub you can see everyone who has contributed to the repository via our [live contributors page][link_contributorslive]. 
(You might have to add `semirahd/Mozilla-NorthAmerican-CampusClub` as the repository name before you click to sign in via GitHub.)


Quoting from their [website][link_hatrackhome]:

> Open Source project contribution focuses a lot on the code committed to projects, but there is so much more that goes on behind the scenes that is just as valuable to FOSS than the code itself.
> 
> LABHR seeks to find those that provide these non-code contributions, and thank them. 
>
> LABHR started as an [idea by Leslie Hawthorn][link_hatrackidea]. She advocates openly thanking people on social media, and writing recommendations.
>
> This idea was extended by Katie McLaughlin with her work on [automating this process on GitHub][link_hatrackcontributions]. 

## How to get in touch

If you have a question or a comment we'd love for you to open an issue because that will be our fastest way of communicating, getting the answers to you and (if necessary) making a change.

If you'd prefer to, contact [Semirah](https://github.com/semirahd) 

## Thank you!

You are awesome. :heart_eyes::sparkles::sunny:
